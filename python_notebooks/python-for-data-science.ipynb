    "Jupyter notebooks are a great way use Python for data analysis! Code cells are interspersed with text written in the formatting syntax Markdown. The Markdown cells can help explain your reasoning and provide other relevant context. The code cells can contain as much or as little code as you like, and the output if a cell is displayed below when the cell is run. To run a cell, select it with your cursor and then hit the \"Run\" button in the menu above (or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter). \n",

A function can be called with just its name, followed by the arguements in parentheses (like `print(\"hello world\")`). Methods cannot be called by themselves; they are always called on an object, with the syntax `object.method()`."
