    "Jupyter notebooks are a great way use Python for data analysis! Code cells are interspersed with text written in the formatting syntax Markdown. The Markdown cells can help explain your reasoning and provide other relevant context. The code cells can contain as much or as little code as you like, and the output if a cell is displayed below when the cell is run. To run a cell, select it with your cursor and then hit the \"Run\" button in the menu above (or use the keyboard shortcut Shift+Enter). \n",

Not all code produces output (importing libraries and variable assignments are two examples of code that doesn't produce an output). If there are any errors, they will also be displayed.

A **string** is a sequence of characters; you tell Python that a sequence is a string by surrounding it in quotation marks. You can use either single or double quotes, but it's recommended that you're consistent. Strings are a specfic **data type** in Python; other data types include integers, floats (or decimal numbers), lists, and boolean (like True or False), but there are many more. The built-in function `type()` will give you the data type of its argument. Try passing differnt types of values to `type()` in the code cell below!"

    "**Tip**: A Python \"method\" is very similar to a function, but is not *quite* the same. The exact differences are not important to us right now, except that there are differences in syntax. A function can be called with just its name, followed by the arguments in parentheses (like `print(\"hello world\")`). Methods cannot be called by themselves; they are always called on an object, with the syntax `object.method()`.\n",
